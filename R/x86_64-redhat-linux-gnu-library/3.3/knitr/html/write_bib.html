<h2>Generate BibTeX bibliography databases for R packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses <code><a href="../../utils/html/citation.html">citation</a></code> and
<code><a href="../../utils/html/toBibtex.html">toBibtex</a></code> to create bib entries for R packages and write
them in a file. Only the auto-generated citations are included for a package.
This function can facilitate the auto-generation of bibliography databases
for R packages, and it is easy to regenerate all the citations after updating
R packages.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
write_bib(x = .packages(), file = "", tweak = TRUE, 
    prefix = getOption("knitr.bib.prefix", "R-"))
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>package names (packages which are not installed are ignored)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (&lsquo;<span class="file">.bib</span>&rsquo;) file to write (by default writes to the R
console; ignored if it is <code>NULL</code>)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tweak</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether to fix some known problems in the citations, especially
non-standard format of authors</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>prefix</code></td>
<td>
<p>a prefix string for keys in BibTeX entries; by default, it is
<span class="samp">R-</span> unless <code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">option</a>('knitr.bib.prefix')</code> has been set to
another string</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The citation is forced to be generated from the &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file of
the package (<code>citation(auto = TRUE)</code>). The keyword <span class="samp">R-pkgname</span> is
used for the bib item, where <span class="samp">pkgname</span> is the name of the package. All
references specified in the &lsquo;<span class="file">CITATION</span>&rsquo; file of the package are ignored.
The main purpose of this function is to automate the generation of the
package citation information because it often changes (e.g. author, year,
package version, ...). By comparison, paper/book citations don't change too
often, so it is not a lot of work even if you just cut and paste such
bibliography entries from <code>toBibtex(citation())</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list containing the citations (also written to the <code>file</code> as a
side effect)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Some packages on CRAN do not have standard bib entries, which was once
reported by Michael Friendly at
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-November/058977.html">https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2010-November/058977.html</a>. I
find this a real pain, and there are no easy solutions except contacting
package authors to modify their DESCRIPTION files. Anyway, the argument
<code>tweak</code> has provided ugly hacks to deal with packages which are known
to be non-standard in terms of the format of citations; <code>tweak = TRUE</code>
is by no means intended to hide or modify the original citation
information. It is just due to the loose requirements on package authors
for the DESCRIPTION file. On one hand, I apologize if it really mangles the
information about certain packages; on the other, I strongly recommend
package authors to consider the <span class="samp">Authors@R</span> field (see the manual
<em>Writing R Extensions</em>) to make it easier for other people to cite R
packages. See <code>knitr:::.tweak.bib</code> for details of tweaks. Also note
this is subject to future changes since R packages are being updated. If
you want to contribute more tweaks, please edit the file
&lsquo;<span class="file">inst/misc/tweak_bib.csv</span>&rsquo; in the source package.

<pre>
write_bib(c("RGtk2", "gWidgets"), file = "R-GUI-pkgs.bib")
write_bib(c("animation", "rgl", "knitr", "ggplot2"))
write_bib(c("base", "parallel", "MASS"))  # base and parallel are identical
write_bib("cluster", prefix = "")  # a empty prefix
write_bib("digest", prefix = "R-pkg-")  # a new prefix
write_bib("digest", tweak = FALSE)  # original version

# what tweak=TRUE does
str(knitr:::.tweak.bib)
